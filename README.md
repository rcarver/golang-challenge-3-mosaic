Instructions for running.

    # Fetch images from Instagram.
    mosaicly fetch -tag cat -num 1000

    # Generate a mosaic from cat photos
    mosaicly gen -tag cat -in photo.jpg -out mosaic.jpg

    # Or generate a mosaic using images in any directory
    mosaicly gen -imgdir ~/Pictures -in photo.jpg -out mosaic.jpg

# Algorithm

  * Build color palette of Len N from images on hand
  * Take Original image
  * Grid = Convert Original to grid
  * PatternImage = Draw Grid as pixels with FloydSteinberg and palette (dither)
  * Output = new image as pixels * unit size
  * For each pixel in PatternImage, pull an image from the palette and place it at x,y
